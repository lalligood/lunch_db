# Overview

Some people can never seem to make up their minds about what they want for lunch, particularly so when other people--especially coworkers seem to get involved. Or it's easy to get stuck in a rut and find yourself eating the same few things every week.

So I created what started as a simple database to track where I go for lunch, and show me a list of places where I haven't eaten for a period of time.

Right now it's only a simple database (I'm a fan of PostgreSQL so that's what I use it on), but perhaps I ought to apply my Python knowledge for something fun, if not personal, to make it easier to use...
